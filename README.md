# Static-Website
Simple website used to showcase the application



## TODO

- make a button to switch between light and dark mode
	- the css will probably be set in the themes/hugo-fresh/assets/fresh/core.scss
	- probably scamm the button from **FixIt** theme


- change logo to ours (when we have one) 

- add devs info

- eventually actually put content
